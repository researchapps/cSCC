# cSCC Documentation
The following files are provided for documentation. If you need more information or have a question, please [open an issue](https://www.github.com/researchapps/cSCC/issues).

 - [algorithm.py](algorithm.py): is a pseudo-code example of the algorithm (in python). It was derived from
 - [cSCCscore121617.pdf](cSCCscore121617.pdf): a description provided by the researchers that developed the tool, also available as [cSCCscore121617.docx](cSCCscore121617.docx).
 - [JavaScript Implementation](https://github.com/researchapps/cSCC/blob/master/index.html#L233) is provided in the `index.html` file served with the repository.
 - [Figure 2](figure-2-12-12-2017.pdf) is provided in a PDF. From the creators of the algorithm:

>> The abscissas of the points in Fig 2 are the sex-specific mean risks assigned by our tool, cSCCscore, to about 60K Kaiser patients classified into tertiles of assigned risk. (The ordinates of the points are the observed incidence of squamous skin cancer in these subjects.)  Clinicians will be most interested in patients in the highest of the 3 tertiles. 

and the rationale for the default settings are addressed in the following comment:

>> So I would say a typical male or female patient might be 60 years old, of moderate or high sunburn sensitivity, with moderate genetic risk, & with prior history of both invasive squamous cell skin cancer and actinic keratoses, but not in-situ or noninvasive skin cancer. 

### Tables
 - [Supplementary Table 1 (markdown)](table.md): provides the table in markdown format.
 - [Supplementary Table 1 (pdf)](table-s1-07-08-2017.pdf) is a provided PDF that shows the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)a in the genetic risk score (GRS). 
 - [Supplementary Table 1 (docx)](table-s1-07-08-2017.docx) is also provided.
